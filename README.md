# Log Analysis and Monitoring Script

## Overview
This script is designed to automate the analysis and monitoring of log files. It continuously monitors a specified log file for new entries and provides basic log analysis functionalities such as counting occurrences of specific keywords or patterns and generating summary reports.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Usage
1. Clone or download the `log_monitor.py` script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `log_monitor.py` script.
3. Run the script with the following command:
Replace `<log_file>` with the path to the log file you want to monitor, and `<keyword1>`, `<keyword2>`, etc., with the keywords or patterns you want to track.
4. The script will start monitoring the specified log file for new entries containing the specified keywords. Any matching entries will be displayed in real-time.
5. To stop monitoring, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

## Testing
You can test the script by following these steps:
1. Prepare a sample log file with some entries containing the keywords you want to monitor.
2. Run the script with the appropriate command-line arguments, specifying the path to the sample log file and the desired keywords.
3. Add new entries to the sample log file and observe if the script correctly detects and displays them in real-time.
4. Verify that the script stops monitoring when `Ctrl+C` is pressed.

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies. The script is written in Python and uses only built-in modules.
